The "Character Counter for Gravity Forms" is a practical WordPress plugin that enhances the functionality of Gravity Forms, a popular form plugin for WordPress. With this plugin, you can monitor the number of characters you input into form fields, ensuring that you stay within the specified character limits. Additionally, it adds a character count feature to Gravity Forms, offering users a visual recommendation without imposing strict character limits. This recommendation serves as a helpful guide for users as they interact with your forms.

**Key Features:**

1. **Display Character Count:** Once the plugin is activated, it automatically displays a character count beneath Gravity Forms fields. This display provides a visual recommendation, showing you how many characters you've entered into a specific field.

2. **Recommendation for Maximum Character Count:** You can also set a recommendation for the maximum character count for each field. It's important to note that this recommendation is solely a visual aid and does not impose strict limits. For instance, if you want users not to exceed 1000 characters, you can set that recommendation. The plugin will then show how many characters you've entered and issue a warning if you surpass the recommended character count. However, users can still input more characters if they wish.

3. **User-Friendly Settings:** The plugin adds a user-friendly settings interface to the Gravity Forms editor. Here, you can specify whether character count should be displayed for each form field and set the recommended maximum character count.

4. **Customizable CSS Styles:** You can customize the appearance of the character count display using custom CSS. This enables seamless integration of the character count display into your website's design.

5. **Reset to Default CSS:** If you ever need to undo your CSS customizations, there's an option to reset the CSS styles to the default settings.

**How to Use the Plugin:**

1. Activate the "Character Counter for Gravity Forms" plugin through the WordPress dashboard.

2. Go to your Gravity Forms forms and edit one of them.

3. Select the field for which you want to enable the character count display and activate the "Display Character Count" option in the form settings.

4. Optionally, set a recommended maximum character count. Please note that this is a recommendation, and users can still exceed it if they choose to.

5. Customize the CSS if you want to change the appearance of the character count display.
